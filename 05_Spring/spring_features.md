# Spring Framework Features

Spring is a comprehensive framework for enterprise Java development. Below are the key features it offers:

## 1. Dependency Injection (DI)
- Manages object creation and their dependencies.
- Promotes loose coupling and testability.
- XML, annotation-based, and Java-based configuration.

## 2. Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)
- Enables modularization of cross-cutting concerns like logging, security, and transactions.
- Uses concepts like advice, pointcuts, and aspects.

## 3. Spring MVC (Model-View-Controller)
- Web framework based on the MVC pattern.
- Supports RESTful web services and integration with view technologies like JSP, Thymeleaf.

## 4. Spring Boot
- Simplifies Spring app development with auto-configuration and starter dependencies.
- Embedded servers (Tomcat, Jetty).
- Minimal configuration required.

## 5. Data Access
- Provides abstraction over JDBC, JPA, Hibernate, MyBatis, etc.
- Manages transactions and reduces boilerplate code.

## 6. Transaction Management
- Declarative and programmatic transaction management.
- Integrates with Java EE, JPA, Hibernate, JTA.

## 7. Spring Security
- Comprehensive security for authentication and authorization.
- Supports OAuth2, JWT, SAML, LDAP, etc.

## 8. Spring Data
- Simplifies data access layer.
- Supports NoSQL (MongoDB, Cassandra), relational databases, and more.

## 9. Spring Cloud
- Tools for building distributed systems and microservices.
- Supports service discovery, configuration management, circuit breakers, etc.

## 10. Spring Batch
- Framework for batch processing of large volumes of data.
- Includes job scheduling, chunk-based processing, and retry mechanisms.

## 11. Spring Integration
- Supports enterprise integration patterns.
- Integrates with messaging systems (JMS, Kafka, RabbitMQ).

## 12. Spring WebFlux
- Reactive programming support.
- Asynchronous, non-blocking I/O with Reactor and Project Reactor.

## 13. Spring Test
- Support for unit and integration testing with JUnit/TestNG.
- Offers mock objects, annotations, and application context loading.

## 14. Spring Expression Language (SpEL)
- Powerful expression language for querying and manipulating objects at runtime.
- Used in bean definitions, security rules, etc.

## 15. Event Handling
- Built-in support for application events.
- Custom event publishing and listener mechanisms.
