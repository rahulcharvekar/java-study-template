## 📌 1. JVM (Java Virtual Machine)
Feature	Details
What it is	A virtual machine that runs Java bytecode
Purpose	Executes .class files (compiled Java code)
Key Role	Platform independence — "Write once, run anywhere"
Includes	Class loader, bytecode verifier, runtime interpreter, garbage collector
Does not include	Java compiler or development tools

🧠 Think of it as the engine that runs Java programs but can’t create them.

## 📌 2. JRE (Java Runtime Environment)
Feature	Details
What it is	JVM + Java libraries (runtime environment)
Purpose	Allows you to run Java applications
Key Role	Provides all necessary classes and files to execute apps
Includes	JVM + core libraries + supporting files
Does not include	Development tools like javac (compiler), debugger

📦 Think of it as a package that contains JVM + everything needed to run a Java app.

## 📌 3. JDK (Java Development Kit)
Feature	Details
What it is	JRE + development tools
Purpose	Allows you to write, compile, and run Java applications
Key Role	Complete toolkit for Java development
Includes	JRE + javac, javadoc, debugger, other tools

🛠️ Think of it as a full toolbox for building Java applications.

### 🔁 Summary in One Line:
JDK = JRE + development tools

JRE = JVM + libraries

JVM = Just the engine that runs Java bytecode

### 🧭 Real-World Analogy:
Component	Analogy
JVM	Like a car engine
JRE	Like a car ready to drive
JDK	Like a car factory where you can build, test, and drive cars
